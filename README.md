## Skills showcased in this app

With Nookr App, I aimed to showcase my skills in several areas, including:

- **MVC architecture:** I structured the app using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with clear separation between data, presentation, and user input. This helps to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** I made use of object-oriented programming principles, specifically the concept of classes, to create modular and maintainable code in the **View**. The Classes provided a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors, and enable encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Vanilla JavaScript:** The app is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without the use of any external frameworks or libraries. This demonstrates my ability to work with the core features of the language and write efficient code.

- **Styling with Sass/Scss:** Styled the app using Sass/Scss — the CSS preprocessor that served as syntactic sugar. This allowed me to write modular and reusable styles, making the styling code more maintainable and easier to update — easier to read too 🤷🏾‍♂️.

**User Interface Design:** The Nookr App is also intended to showcase an eye for creating simple, yet visually appealing user interfaces that prioritize usability and accessibility. I drew from various design trends and elements across different apps and platforms, resulting in a unique and modern look and feel for the app.

Overall, I believe that this project demonstrates my ability to build a robust and maintainable web application using modern web development tools and techniques. Credit to Jonas Schmedtmann for his incredible course and API.


## Cloning or Forking the App

As a fellow **developer,** if you want to use Nookr as a starting point for your own project, you can clone or fork the app from the GitHub repository. To clone the app and access it from your machine, run the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
# Clone the Nookr-App repository from GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/HAYVENO/Nookr-App.git

# Change directory to the Nookr-App folder
$ cd Nookr-App

# Install all the necessary dependencies for the project using npm

```
Now let's discuss Nookr.

## How does Nookr work?

To begin, simply type in the name of the dish that you want to cook, and Nookr will provide you with a list of ingredients and detailed instructions on how to prepare the meal. Nookr currently only allows you to search for recipes by dish name.

> Nookr: Your push to delicious meals every day!

You can also **save your favorite dishes** to a favorites list for easy access later.

## Why use Nookr?

Nookr is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. Whether you're in the kitchen or on the go, Nookr is a great resource for finding ingredients and cooking instructions for any meal.

Plus, with Nookr's **Search by dish name** feature and the ability to **save your favorite dishes**, you can quickly and easily access the recipes that you love.

Go from **Noob-cook** to **King-Chef** in minutes with **Nookr - your personal kitchen companion. 😉**

OK, don't mind my mid attempt at marketing. But if you find the work I did with the app beautiful, or you just as much as enjoyed the READ ME, please don't hesitate to star 🌟 the repo. Thanks!
