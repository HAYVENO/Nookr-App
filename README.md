Let Nookr take the guesswork out of cooking.

## What is Nookr?

Nookr is a simple and easy-to-use app that allows you to search for ingredients and cooking instructions for meals. It doesn't matter what part of the world you are from, Nookr's catalogue of 500k+ recipes sure has something for you.

## Skills showcased in this app

With Nookr App, I aimed to showcase my skills in several areas, including:

- **MVC architecture:** I structured the app using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with clear separation between data, presentation, and user input. This helps to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** I made use of object-oriented programming principles, specifically the concept of classes, to create modular and maintainable code in the **View**. The Classes provided a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors, and enable encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Vanilla JavaScript:** The app is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without the use of any external frameworks or libraries. This demonstrates my ability to work with the core features of the language and write efficient code.

- **Styling with Sass/Scss:** Styled the app using Sass/Scss — the CSS preprocessor that served as syntactic sugar. This allowed me to write modular and reusable styles, making the styling code more maintainable and easier to update — easier to read too 🤷🏾‍♂️.

Overall, I believe that this project demonstrates my ability to build a robust and maintainable web application using modern web development tools and techniques.

Now let's discuss Nookr.

## How does Nookr work?

To begin, simply type in the name of the dish that you want to cook, and Nookr will provide you with a list of ingredients and detailed instructions on how to prepare the meal. Nookr currently only allows you to search for recipes by dish name.
